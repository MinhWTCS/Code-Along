      //With our current allowance, how many battle pass will we be able to buy?
    //ANSWER: With our allowance we could buy 2 battle passes. Each one cost $15. and we have a budget of 40.50. So we should divide the budget with the cost to get the amount we can afford. $40.50/15 = 2.7
      //What is the total cost of battle passes
    // The cost of one battle pass is $15, andwe can afford 2 of them. TO calculate the cost of the passes, we should multiply the cost with the amount can buy. $15 x 2 = $30.
